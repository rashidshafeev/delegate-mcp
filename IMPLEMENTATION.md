# Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the delegate-mcp server with its streamlined functionality.

## Implemented Features

### Tools

1. **prepare_context**
   - Accepts array of file paths
   - Accepts a comment to append
   - Concatenates file contents with path headers
   - Pushes to GitHub (with default repository settings from env vars)

2. **delegate**
   - Accepts a prompt for Gemini models
   - Supports pinning context (array of file paths + comment)
   - Implements "realtime" flag to control response handling
   - Saves both conversation and model responses to GitHub

### Configuration

- Streamlined environment variables focused on Gemini and GitHub
- Default values for repository settings

### Providers

- Only Gemini provider is active
- Other providers (OpenAI and Anthropic) are marked for removal

## Files Modified

- `src/utils/config.ts` - Updated to include only required environment variables
- `src/providers/index.ts` - Modified to initialize only Gemini provider
- `src/context/packager.ts` - Implemented for specific file path handling and concatenation
- `src/mcp/tools/prepare-context.ts` - Implemented with new schema and functionality
- `src/mcp/tools/delegate.ts` - Implemented with realtime flag and context support
- `src/mcp/server.ts` - Updated to register only the two required tools
- `src/index.ts` - Streamlined for focused implementation
- `package.json` - Updated to remove unnecessary dependencies
- `README.md` - Added detailed installation and usage instructions
- `src/providers/anthropic.ts` - Marked for removal
- `src/providers/openai.ts` - Marked for removal
- `.env.example` - Added sample environment variables file

## Files Not Changed (Still Compatible)

- `src/utils/github.ts` - Core functionality for GitHub operations is still needed
- `src/utils/logger.ts` - Utility for logging
- `src/utils/token-counter.ts` - Utility for counting tokens
- `src/providers/base.ts` - Base provider interface and registry
- `src/providers/gemini.ts` - Gemini provider implementation

## Future Enhancements

1. **Enhanced token management** (Issue #3)
   - More accurate token counting
   - Intelligent file chunking
   - Smart file prioritization

2. **Asynchronous delegation** (Issue #4)
   - Job tracking system
   - Job status queries
   - Webhook notifications

3. **Smart context preparation** (Issue #7)
   - Repository analysis
   - File importance ranking
   - Context customization based on query

## Tests and Documentation

- A comprehensive test suite should be implemented (Issue #6)
- Additional examples should be added to documentation

## Required Environment Variables

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
GITHUB_API_KEY=your_github_token
OWNER=your_github_username
REPO=your_github_repo
BRANCH=main
```

## Usage Example

```bash
# Start MCP server
npm start

# Check provider availability
npm start -- check
```

Tool usage examples are provided in the README.
