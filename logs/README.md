# Logs Directory

This directory contains log files generated by the delegate-mcp application. These logs are particularly useful for debugging JSON-RPC communication issues with Claude or other LLM clients.

## Log Files

Different transports and debug modes create different log files:

- `direct-server-*.log`: Logs from the pure JavaScript direct server implementation
- `direct-transport-*.log`: Logs from the TypeScript DirectTransport implementation
- `debug-*.log`: General debug logs from other transport modes

## Usage

Log files are automatically created when running the server with any of the debug modes:

```bash
# Run the pure JavaScript direct server
npm run server:direct

# Run the TypeScript direct transport
npm run debug:direct

# Run the simple debug server
npm run debug:simple
```

## Troubleshooting

When experiencing JSON-RPC communication issues with Claude, check these logs to:

1. Verify the message format being sent and received
2. Confirm that JSON serialization is working correctly
3. Identify any parsing errors or malformed requests/responses
4. Debug position-specific issues in the JSON stream that might cause Claude to reject messages

The logs are formatted with timestamps to help track the sequence of events during communication.
